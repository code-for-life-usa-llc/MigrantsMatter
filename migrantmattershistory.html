<h2> Chinese Exclusion Act (1882): </h2>
  <h3> This was the first major law to restrict immigration based on race or nationality—the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. It banned Chinese laborers from entering the U.S. and denied Chinese immigrants the right to become citizens. Driven by racism and economic fears, the law reflected widespread belief that Chinese workers threatened white laborers' jobs and wages. It led to systemic discrimination, violence, and the social isolation of Chinese communities, who faced exclusion from education, housing, and employment. The Act also set a precedent for future racially discriminatory immigration policies and remained in place for over 60 years, leaving a nlasting impact on U.S. society and immigration law. </h3>
  <h2> Internment of Japanese Americans (1942–1945): </h2>
  <h3> During World War II, the U.S. government forcibly relocated and imprisoned around 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry—two-thirds of whom were American citizens—in internment camps across the country. This mass incarceration was not based on any proven acts of espionage or sabotage, but rather on wartime hysteria, racial prejudice, and unfounded fears that Japanese Americans might be loyal to Imperial Japan. Executive Order 9066, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942, authorized the military to designate “exclusion zones” and remove anyone deemed a threat to national security—effectively targeting Japanese Americans on the West Coast simply because of their ethnic background. Families were given just days to sell their property and belongings before being sent to remote camps surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by armed soldiers. The internment resulted in severe emotional, financial, and social consequences. People lost homes, businesses, and their sense of belonging in the country they had called home for generations. Despite their treatment, many Japanese Americans still served in the U.S. military, including the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, one of the most decorated units in American history. Decades later, the U.S. government formally acknowledged the injustice. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act, which offered a formal apology and financial reparations to surviving internees. The internment of Japanese Americans stands as a stark reminder of how fear and racism can override constitutional rights, even in a democracy. </h3>
  <h2> Bracero Program Abuses (1942–1964): </h2>
  <h3> While the Bracero Program, initiated in 1942, allowed Mexican laborers to work temporarily in the U.S. to address labor shortages during and after World War II, it also exposed them to widespread exploitation and abuse. The program brought over 4.5 million workers to the U.S., primarily for agricultural and railroad jobs, under promises of fair wages, decent housing, and legal protections. However, in practice, many braceros were underpaid, forced to live in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, and subjected to grueling labor without proper safety measures. Employers often violated contracts with little to no consequences, and government oversight was weak or inconsistent. Some workers had portions of their wages withheld as part of a savings program that was supposed to. </h3>
