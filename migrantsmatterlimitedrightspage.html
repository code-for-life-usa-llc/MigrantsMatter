<div class="text">Navigating the complex landscape of international borders and national sovereignty, migrants often face significant hurdles in realizing their full human rights, particularly those in an irregular situation, who find themselves disproportionately vulnerable to discrimination, exploitation, and marginalization. The denial of migrants' rights is frequently connected to discriminatory laws and deeply entrenched attitudes of prejudice or xenophobia within host societies. While international human rights documents firmly establish the principle that no human being can be deemed "illegal" or outside the protection of the law, says the American Civil Liberties Union, national immigration laws and policies can create a precarious existence for those without legal status, often leaving them afraid to complain and operating in the shadows. 
Even when possessing legal status, migrants, especially those with limited English proficiency, can face significant challenges accessing essential services like healthcare and education, navigating bureaucratic processes, securing stable employment, and finding safe, affordable housing. Concerns about the potential impact of immigration on national security, the economy, and social cohesion can lead to the implementation of restrictive policies, creating further barriers for migrants. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that many migrants are motivated by a desire for better opportunities and improved quality of life for themselves and their families, says KFF. Addressing the challenges faced by migrants requires a human rights-based approach that prioritizes their dignity and well-being, including establishing firewalls between immigration enforcement and service provision to ensure migrants can access vital resources without fear. International cooperation and support from non-governmental organizations are also essential in creating a more inclusive and just environment for all migrants, irrespective of their legal status.
